# emacs-nobinds -- Emacs Without Default Keybindings

Emacs is known for it's default stupid keybindings, so this project removes them all (or almost, very few still got through).

emacs-nobinds is based on emacs-26, changes done to emacs-26 to bring this version to life can be viewed in this PR (which will never be closed): https://github.com/lawleagle/emacs-nobinds/pull/1
